# Nitro Sniping Queue Bot

Nitro Sniping Queue Bot is a specialized Discord bot designed for efficiently managing user queues in Nitro sniping activities. 
This bot allows you to sell credits to users, and when they redeem these credits, they are placed in a queue. 
The user at the front of the queue gets the opportunity to snipe a Nitro code.

This queue bot is a derivative of the original version developed for "Tsukuyomi Sniper". 
Regrettably, the original bot is no longer functional due to the shutdown of "Tsukuyomi Sniper".
